# Electricity Usage Prediction â€“ Proof of Concept

Forecasting electricity consumption using meter data.

---

## Business Problem

Accurately forecasting electricity usage is crucial for energy providers, businesses, and households to optimize costs, plan resources, and support sustainability. This project addresses the challenge of predicting electricity consumption using historical meter data, enabling better demand management and operational efficiency.

---

## Solution Overview

This Proof of Concept leverages Python, pandas, and visualization libraries to:

- Ingest and clean raw electricity usage data  
- Explore consumption patterns (hourly, daily, seasonal)  
- Engineer features and build predictive models  
- Evaluate model performance and perform robustness checks  

All analysis is performed in a single, well-documented Jupyter notebook:  
[`notebooks/electricity_predictor.ipynb`](notebooks/electricity_predictor.ipynb)

## Business Requirements

- **Data Ingestion:** Read and combine multiple CSV files of hourly usage data.  
- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, inconsistent formats, and outliers.  
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Visualize usage by hour, day, and season.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features (e.g., season, peak hours).  
- **Prediction:** Build and evaluate models to forecast future usage.  
- **Interpretability:** Provide clear visualizations and business insights.

## Thought Process & Analysis Flow
### [Data Import & Setup](notebooks/electricity_predictor.ipynb#Import-Data):  
  Load and combine raw data, set up environment variables for configuration.

### - [Data Cleaning & Preparation](notebooks/electricity_predictor.ipynb#Data-Exploration):  
  Handle missing values, convert data types, and prepare for analysis.

### - [Exploratory Data Analysis](notebooks/electricity_predictor.ipynb#Hourly-Patterns:-Peak-and-Off-Peak-Times):  
The notebook performs a thorough EDA by visualizing electricity usage patterns at multiple granularities. It analyzes hourly, daily, and seasonal trends, identifying peak and off-peak hours, and comparing usage between summer and winter. The analysis includes line plots and bar charts to show average, maximum, and minimum usage by hour, as well as grouped statistics by season. Visualizations reveal clear peak and off-peak hours, as well as differences between summer and winter usage. These insights highlight when and why electricity demand fluctuates.

### - [Feature Engineering](notebooks/electricity_predictor.ipynb#Hourly-by-Season):  
Feature engineering steps include creating a 'Season' column to distinguish between winter and summer months, and extracting hour-based features from the timestamp data. The notebook also explores the impact of these features on usage patterns, preparing the data for predictive modeling by ensuring all relevant temporal and categorical information is captured.

### - [Modeling & Prediction](notebooks/electricity_predictor.ipynb#Modeling):  
The modeling section builds and evaluates machine learning models to predict electricity usage. It splits the data into training and test sets, applies regression algorithms (such as linear regression and potentially others), and evaluates model performance using metrics like RMSE and MAE. The notebook includes code for fitting models, making predictions, and visualizing prediction errors to assess model accuracy.

### - [Robustness Checks](notebooks/electricity_predictor.ipynb#Robustness-Checks):  
Robustness checks are performed to validate the stability and reliability of the predictive models. This includes testing model performance on holdout datasets, checking sensitivity to different feature sets, and comparing results across various data splits. The notebook documents these checks to ensure that the findings are not dependent on specific assumptions or random chance.

### - [Business Insights & Conclusions](notebooks/electricity_predictor.ipynb#Conclusions):  
  Summarize findings and actionable recommendations.
